## Code used for my testing of multimodal embeddings

I created an `xkcd-images/` folder to store each image file locally. You'll need to download them yourself (responsibly).

You can download the database of vectors in the [release](https://github.com/danclaytondev/relevant-xkcd-post/releases/tag/v0.1.0). 

### Disclaimer

I have used `uv` for managing Python dependencies. `uv` seems awesome but I can't promise that this will run perfectly.

I used `uv run --with jupyer jupyter lab` in this directory to launch the notebook with dependencies from this project available in the default kernel.
